# chatGPT - HUGE Input

## Why this?

I needed to "train" chatGPT for recent documentation on some APIS, but how could I train it with so many documentation text in a fast way?
well, I just need to download the docs, place them inside an one text file and upload it to chatGPT
now it will now all recent docs on that specific API

## How to use?

* Open chatgpt in your browser
* Copy text from **code.js**
* Press F12 (developer stuff)
* Paste the code there
* A upload button should appear

## How to input

* Write:
```
Hi, I'll train you now for reading a documentation (or source code, or a large text) while I dont say without quotes "done, did it" just answer with "got it!"
```

* Now upload your .txt file and wait for it to send all text
* after finished just send this to chatGPT: `done, did it`
* Have fun asking about the text you sent!
